# This is a sample Makefile for Phase 1. It provides the following targets 
# (assumes test source files are named testN.c)
# You may change this, e.g. to add new test cases, but keep in mind we will compile
# your phase1.c using our own copy of this file.
#
#	make		(makes libphase1.a and all tests)
#        make phase1     ditto
#
#	make testN 	(makes testN)
#	make testN.out	(runs testN and puts output in testN.out)
#	make tests	(makes all testN.out files, i.e. runs all tests)
#	make tests_bg	(runs all tests in the background)
#
#	make testN.v	(runs valgrind on testN and puts output in testN.v)
#	make valgrind	(makes all testN.v files, i.e. runs valgrind on all tests)
#
#	make clean	(removes all files created by this Makefile)
